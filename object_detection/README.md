# Object Detection with pre-trained Faster RCNN model on the Visual Genome dataset

This repository is based on [Faster R-CNN with model pretrained on Visual Genome](https://github.com/shilrley6/Faster-R-CNN-with-model-pretrained-on-Visual-Genome) which provides the pre-trained Faster RCNN model for object detection. Thanks to [Faster R-CNN with model pretrained on Visual Genome](https://github.com/shilrley6/Faster-R-CNN-with-model-pretrained-on-Visual-Genome), small modifications were made by us to employ this module for local branch in our OSANet. 

To use this model for our local branch in OSANet, you should follow the guideline provided by original repository. Note that the pre-trained pt file should be downloaded and located at [load_dir](https://github.com/sange1104/OSANet/tree/main/object_detection/load_dir).
